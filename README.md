# Project Description

# Employee Data Management - Design

## File

* *None*

## Instructions

* For the next 20 minutes, focus all your efforts on creating the application layout for your site.

* This phase involves both:

  * Creating the overall HTML/CSS/Bootstrap Layout

  * Creating the initial `.on("click")` event that will dynamically trigger new HTML rows to be generated.

* This phase DOES NOT involve sending or receiving data to Firebase.

* If you finish early:

  * Continue refining the design! Take things to the next level. Make this application portfolio-grade!

  * Begin reading about `push({})` and `.on("child_added")` in the Firebase documentation.
